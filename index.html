                <h2>Working in Quebec City</h2>
                <p><img src="http://lorempixel.com/600/400/city/5/" alt="working in quebec city">Quebec City and the surrounding region boast a robust economy, a very low unemployment rate and an outstanding work environment. According to recent projections by Employment Quebec, approximately 70,000 positions will have to be filled in the region over the next five years.</p>
                <p>Thanks to a booming economy and a shrinking workforce (due to aging, retirement, etc.), Quebec City and the surrounding region offer a wide range of exciting job opportunities, not to mention one of the lowest unemployment rates in Canada.</p>
                <p>Quebec City’s economy is thriving, while a number of sectors are looking to hire workers. High technology is one of Quebec City’s main economic drivers, thanks in particular to the creativity and productivity of its industrial sector and scientific community. Sectors of excellence such as optics/photonics, life sciences, insurance and financial services, ICT and electronics, food processing and green/intelligent buildings are all hiring skilled workers, who are in high demand. These sectors are strengthening the region’s position and enhancing the standing of Quebec City and its workforce around the world.</p>

                <h2>Living in Quebec City</h2>
                <p>In addition to its beauty, Quebec City offers an unbeatable quality of life for newcomers.</p>
                <p>Quebec City and the surrounding region are bordered by the majestic St. Lawrence River, one of North America’s most important waterways. Home to 765,706 people, the metropolitan region also has dozens of smaller rivers. Quebec City is the capital of the province of Quebec.</p>
                <p>The Quebec City region is located in the southeastern corner of the province of Quebec, close to the US border. It is characterized by luxuriant mixed Laurentian forests and a large number of lakes and mountains—an ideal environment for getaways and outdoor recreational activities (e.g. hiking, skiing, cycling, snowmobiling, boating, hunting, fishing, dogsledding, etc.).</p>
                <p>Quebec City was founded in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain. At its heart is Old Quebec City (also know as Vieux-Québec), the only fortified urban district in North America and a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. The streets of Quebec City are steeped in 400 years of history. They are also graced by a unique multifaceted architectural environment. Walking past the tall stone houses and their multi-coloured roofs is a fascinating experience!</p>
